The Issue Summary:
Duration of the outage: Occurred on May 12, 2024, from 3:00 PM to 6:30 PM (GMT).

Impact: The outage affected the availability of our e-commerce platform, resulting in a 30% decrease in user traffic and a loss of potential revenue.

The Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.

Timeline:
3:00 PM: The issue was detected by monitoring alerts indicating a sudden drop in server response times.
3:10 PM: Engineers began investigating the issue, initially suspecting a database overload.
3:45 PM: Further investigation revealed that the load balancer was not distributing traffic evenly due to misconfigured routing rules.
4:00 PM: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for assistance.
6:30 PM: The misconfiguration was corrected, restoring normal traffic flow.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The issue originated from a recent adjustment we made to the load balancer configuration. Unfortunately, this tweak caused an imbalance in traffic distribution across our servers, resulting in performance issues for our users. To address this, we reverted the load balancer settings to their previous state and implemented automated tests to validate configurations before deployment, ensuring smoother operations moving forward.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Regular audits of load balancer configurations to identify and correct any discrepancies.
Implementation of automated testing for load balancer configurations as part of the deployment pipeline.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations to identify any additional misconfigurations.

Update documentation and procedures for load balancer configuration management to prevent similar issues in the future.

Schedule regular training sessions for DevOps teams to ensure awareness of best practices for load balancer management.

By implementing these measures, we aim to minimize the risk of future outages caused by misconfigured load balancers and maintain the reliability and availability of our e-commerce platform.
